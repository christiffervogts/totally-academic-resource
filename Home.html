      <h1> HELLO! </h1>
      <p> This is a page where I plan to put both the academic things that I create as well as the games I make!
      <br><br> Who am I? <br> To start my name is Chris (He/Him), I am a Freshman in college and I am studying mechanical engineering. I don't have huge amounts of time so I am unsure how often this will be updated but even if you don't see me update here in a while please check out the links (pictures) to the left. I speak, some, german and know how to use Java, and I'm currently learning C. My most recent project is one calculator to rule them all. I am also the creator of amicusia, Although it looks like it is abandoned I am just going through and fully reworking how collision works and that is turning out to be a larger project than I anticipated, so new stuff has slowed. I also do ceramics. You can see it in the my art tab once I've added it!
      <br><br> To your right you'll see a button asking about cookies. <br><br> Yes! I have a plan where I wil use cookies for good. I am currently on the free plan of neocities so I cannot show ads either way but when I upgrade to  the paid plan I will only show ads if you agree to the cookies. This way, should you want to support me in a free way, then for one day you can see ads on my site then 24hr later they will disappear. <b> You have 100% control over whether or not you see ads. Nothing will be blocked if you choose not to see ads.</b> What is Planed? <br> Currently I want to add three sections. School, Games, and Misc. School will be mostly two things: lessons, and tools. Under games will be (with the exception of my larger fully fleshed out games) all my games that I make, I want to make chess, wordle, and some "gambling" games like blackjack, poker. The last thing I want to do is add a miscellaneous section where I put anything I think would be funny or wouldn't fit with the other two sections. So while I may show some tips on how to wheel throw any ceramics that I actually make will be under misc, pics. Another example is a wall of ads. I think it would be funny if at some point the only ads on the site were all in one page and by clicking it I would gain a bunch of money, you'd have no way of miss clicking onto an ad and it would feel kinda weird to <b> just </b> see ads and nothing else. Lastly dev notes for Amicusia will be under their own section of misc so you can see what I have done every once in a while.
      <br><br><br> Please give me time to learn HTML, js, css!
      <br><br><br> You can bookmark this for later if you'd like! <p>
